# Bird Watching Mobile Application

This repository is my final POE submission for the module Open Source Coding (Intermediate) (OPSC7312).

## About the application:

The assignment was to create a bird watching application for android devices using Kotlin. The application needed to allow users to add observations of bird species to the map and be able to navigate to a bird sighting hotspot. The data needed to be pulled from the eBird API. 

Hotspots and observations needed to be displayed on a map. 

There needed to be user control such as login and logout. Users also needed to be able to view their own observations.

## Google Play Store

There were bonus marks if we were able to publish the application to the Google Play Store.

## Application Framework:

Made using Android Studio Electric Eel with API 33 Android 13.

Using Firebase Authentication for login and signup, Firebase Firestore to store user settings and user observations and eBird to retrieve all hotspot and sightings data

We used MapBox and Google maps. We are using Google Maps to display hotspots and observations, this is the map shown in the main form. We are using MapBox to cater for navigation. We are using both as they have strengths and weaknesses, and doing it this way allows us to maximize the benefits. 

## Android device requirements:

The device must be able to use Google Play Store services.
We recommend the basic Pixel 4 with Google Play running Android version 13 (Tiramisu) with API level 33.
